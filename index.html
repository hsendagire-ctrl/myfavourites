      <h2>Basketball</h2>

      <p>
        This is one of two of my favourite sports of all time. While I might
        like something like soccer slightly better, Basketball is a game I can
        easily pick up, and play with my friends with <b>no</b> hassle. Core
        points of the sport include:
      </p>

      <ul class="lists">
        <li><b>Swinging</b> the Ball</li>
        <li><b>Scoring</b> any way possible</li>
        <li><b>And working</b> with your team on defense</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Try it for yourself, and get some friends as well to pick up for your
        team. With versions like King Of The Court, 3v3, 5v5, 1v1, etc. you will
        <b>never</b> get tired. Watch

      <h2>Soccer: The Beautiful Game</h2>
      <img src="img/soccerfield.jpg" alt="Soccer Field" />
      <p>
        You can't go wrong with a sport that is named with such a subtitle, and
        yet breaks beyond just one name for itself. Most other places call it
        Football, but one thing is agreed upon. It's a team sport that's sure to
        bring good memories to all who play, which is why it will forever be my
        personal favourite sport. Pillars of the sport include:
      </p>
      <ul class="lists">
        <li><b>Tons</b> of Cardio,</li>
        <li><b>Poisitions</b> for players,</li>
        <li><b>Maintaining</b> Posession</li>
        <li><b>Overall</b> communicating with your team</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is a sport that simply speaks for itself, <b>10/10.</b> Watch

      <h2>Biking</h2>
      <img src="img/biking.webp" alt="Picture of Biking" />
      <p>
        To me, almost nothing beats the thrill of riding my bike down the trail,
        feeling pure adrenaline and excitement. Biking brings joy to me every
        spring & summer, and riding my bike is like second nature though I only
        learned recently. Switching gears to accomodate a downhill or uphill is
        almost poetic, and as long as you're riding with a full bottle of water,
        you'll never be disappointed.
      </p>
      <ul class="lists">
        <li><b>Pedal</b> at your own pace</li>
        <li><b>Shift gears</b> before going uphill or downhill</li>
        <li><b>Always</b> travel with a water bottle</li>
        <li><b>Take breaks</b> if you're tired!</li>
        <p>
          Not enough words describe the <b>feeling</b> of biking. Try it for
          yourself, and watch
